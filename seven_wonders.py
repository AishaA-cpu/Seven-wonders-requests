# goal of this is to to demonstrate making requests using python code instead of postman(a tool for making API requests and
# receiving responses)
# we will be using requests a py. library used to facilitate making api requests, you can also set rate limits so that
# we dont get an error with requests(read docs)
# in requests we need to set the path, set the query params like query string, formart etc
# for apis that need auth keys we also need to set the keys are global constants
